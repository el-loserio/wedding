Those of you travelling from outside Glasgow (or planning a very heavy night) will probably be looking for accommodation.
Glasgow has plenty of hotels available around the city centre, but we've found a couple to give you a head-start.
If you are having trouble you can also contact Mother of the Bride and hotel booking meister Terry Carlysle.
