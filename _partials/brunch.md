## Brunch
<a name="brunch"/>

We know a lot of you will be travelling quite a distance for the wedding, and that on the wedding day itself we won't get much of a chance to catch up with you (much as we'll try to talk to everyone!).
On Sunday we're going to be going out for brunch and we'd like to invite anybody who wants to come along to join us, and get another chance to meet in a slightly less formal environment before everybody has to head off home.
We're going to be at the [Edward G Wylie](https://www.jdwetherspoon.com/pubs/all-pubs/scotland/glasgow/the-edward-g-wylie-glasgow) on Bothwell St, since it should be big enough for everybody who wants to come, and hopefully won't be too busy.
It's also very conveniently placed for Central Station, or for the bus to the airport.
Feel free to drop in at any time, and stay for as long or as little as you want â€“ we're planning on getting there around 11, and we've got a couple of tables booked.
