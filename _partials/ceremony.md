## Ceremony

For our ceremony, we wanted something that meant something to both of us.
Since Steven's parents are from Maryhill, we're going to hold our ceremony at the church of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception, and the ceremony will (hopefully) be carried out by Felicity's childhood priest, Fr. Kieron (possibly with the assistance of Fr. Jim) , who'll be flying up for the occasion.

The ceremony will (probably) start at 2pm.
The church is on Maryhill Road, a couple of minutes walk from Maryhill train station, and it also has plenty of parking.
We're also considering the possibility of putting on a bus from Glasgow city centre, so do let us know if you think you'd want to take advantage of that.
