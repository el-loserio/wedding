## Ceremony
<a name="ceremony"/>

For our ceremony, we wanted something that meant something to both of us.
Since Steven's parents are from Maryhill, we're going to hold our ceremony there, at the church of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception, and the ceremony will (hopefully) be carried out by Felicity's childhood priest, Fr. Kieron (possibly with the assistance of Fr. Jim) , who'll be flying up for the occasion. Don't worry we will be providing orders of service and it won't be a full nuptial mass.

The ceremony will start at 2pm.
The church is on Maryhill Road, and it has plenty of parking.
Unfortunately, while it's only a couple of minutes walk from Maryhill train station, due to engineering work at Queen St Station, there are currently no direct trains from Glasgow city centre.
If you want to take the train, you'll need to change at Anniesland and it'll take about 40 minutes.
There are buses (numbers 60/60A/61) that take around 25 minutes from Buchanan St, and taxis should be readily available throughout the city centre.

Anybody who's planning on arriving early (hint: all of you!) might want to know there might be another wedding on before ours, but they should be out the way in plenty of time.
