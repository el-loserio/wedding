## Wedding Party
<a name="party"/>

### The Bride: Felicity

Felicity is smart, sweet, caring and dedicated to the things she believes in.
Steven first met Felicity at Strathclyde when they were both doing their PhDs and involved in the GIST, a science magazine.
Obviously, this shared interest should have led to love at first sight, but instead Steven decided Felicity was "a bit posh", and promptly made no effot to get to know her for several months.
Fate wouldn't keep them apart however, and when Steven started going along to the post-graduate society, which Felicity later became president of, he started to realise quite how awesome she was.
What followed was a long period of Steven perhaps working a bit harder for the society than he would have otherwise, and trying to impress her with a selection of baked goods.
Amazingly, this strategy eventually paid off, and since they got together, they've seen each other through some hard times, and some amazing times, including Felicity proving just how much she loved him by proof-reading his thesis.
Felicity's ability to make Steven happy just by being there, her sense of humour and loving nature have proved just how lucky he was, and will be for the rest of his life.

Steven no longer works quite as hard to impress her, but she does still demand baked goods from time to time.

### The Groom: Steven

Steven is a computer nerd, luckily for him after getting to know him better Felicity thinks that this is one of his most endearing features (and meant she had a really nicely formatted Thesis).
Aside from his ability to photoshop the heads of animals onto the bodies of other animals (play 'Galapa Go!' if you struggle to see the appeal), Felicity also fell in love with his caring nature and ability to make her laugh. 
He is a great cook with his Burn's night supper being the unmissable event of the year, and any post wedding weight gain will be due to him being forced to make his delicious (but highly calorific) white chocolate and raspberry cheesecake on a weekly basis.
In short Steven is one of a kind and sorry ladies he is off the market.

### Bride's Parents: Bob & Terry

### Groom's Parents: Michael & Margaret
Michael and Margaret have been very welcoming since they first met Felicity over a New Year's Day pie. There is always a can of full fat Coke or Irn Bru waiting for her in their fridge and they very politely don't mention when it is very obvious that she and Steven have come over to visit the puppy rather than them. 


### Best Man: Gary

Gary and Steven became friends over the course of second-year Latin class, where they shared an interest in playing table football and not paying much attention to Latin.
That friendship persisted all through school, university and beyond, despite living many miles from each other for several years, and over time their shared interests grew to include wrestling, hill-walking, beer, boardgames, and an unhealthy interest in maths stats and maths jokes.

Neither of them remembers any Latin.

### Bridesmaids: Nicola, Tina & Vicky

Nicola and Felicity became friends when doing their PhDs at Strathclyde.
During this time they bonded over a love of Irn Bru and Dominos pizza and had several adventures including traveling across Lake Geneva on a paddle steamer (and somehow convincing the uni to pay for it).

Tina had the misfortune to be stuck in the PhD office while on a year long placement.
Despite being a smelly undergrad she was welcomed into the fold and has become a source of great support and rude jokes.

Vicky has known Felicity since school and despite this they are still friends.
Having started the friendship having long chats via MSN messenger this switched to Facebook messenger and watching Downton Abbey with each other despite being at opposite ends of the country â€“ technology at its finest.

### Ring-bearer: Jamie

Jamie is Felicity's youngest cousin and is also her godson.
Felicity and Jamie spent one summer obsessively playing Lego Harry Potter on the Wii when Felicity was living nearby while on a 3 month placement at the Forensic Explosives Laboratory.
This also meant that Felicity got to be Jamie's cool cousin who has a job blowing things up (not totally accurate, but she was happy to take the kudos).
