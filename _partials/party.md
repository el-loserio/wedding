### Groom's Parents: Michael & Margaret

### Best Man: Gary

### Bridesmaids: Nicola, Tina & Vicky
Nicola and Felicity became friends when doing their PhDs at Strathclyde. During this time they bonded over a love of Irn Bru and Dominos pizza and had several adventures including traveling across Lake Geneva on a paddle steamer (and somehow convincing the uni to pay for it)
Tina had the misfortune to be stuck in the PhD office while on a year long placement. Despite being a smelly undergrad she was welcomed into the fold and has become a source of great support and rude jokes.
Vicky has known Felicity since school and despite this they are still friends. Having started the friendship having long chats via MSN messenger this switched to Facebook messenger and watching Downton Abbey with each other despite being at opposite ends of the country - technology at its finest.

### Ring-bearer: Jamie
