## Wedding Party
<a name="party"/>

### The Bride: Felicity

### The Groom: Steven
Steven is a computer nerd, luckily for him Felicity thinks that this is one of his most endearing features (and meant she had a really nicely formatted Thesis). Aside from his ability to photoshop the heads of animals onto the bodies of other animals, Felicity also fell in love with his caring nature and ability to make her laugh. He is a great cook with his Burn's night supper being the unmissable event of the year, and any post wedding weight gain will be due to him being forced to make his delicious (but highly calorific) White chocolate and raspberry cheesecake on a weekly basis. 

### Bride's Parents: Bob & Terry

### Groom's Parents: Michael & Margaret

### Best Man: Gary

### Bridesmaids: Nicola, Tina & Vicky
Nicola and Felicity became friends when doing their PhDs at Strathclyde. During this time they bonded over a love of Irn Bru and Dominos pizza and had several adventures including traveling across Lake Geneva on a paddle steamer (and somehow convincing the uni to pay for it)
Tina had the misfortune to be stuck in the PhD office while on a year long placement. Despite being a smelly undergrad she was welcomed into the fold and has become a source of great support and rude jokes.
Vicky has known Felicity since school and despite this they are still friends. Having started the friendship having long chats via MSN messenger this switched to Facebook messenger and watching Downton Abbey with each other despite being at opposite ends of the country - technology at its finest.

### Ring-bearer: Jamie
Jamie is Felicity's youngest cousin and is also her godson. Felicity and Jamie spent one summer obsessively playing Lego Harry Potter on the Wii when Felicity was living nearby while on a 3 month placement at the Forensic Explosives Laboratory. This also meant that Felicity got to be Jamie's cool cousin who has a job blowing things up (not totally accurate, but she was happy to take the kudos).
