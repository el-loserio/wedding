After the ceremony, we're going to be moving on to the reception at the lovely Killearn Village Hall, with picturesque views of the surrounding Campsies.

The timetable is still provisional at the moment, but we're expecting it to be something like:

* 15:30 – Drinks and photos
* 17:00 – Speeches and dinner
* 20:00 – Cake cutting, followed by ceilidh
* 21:45 - Evening buffet
* 23:30 – Last orders
* 00:00 – Coach leaves

We'll be be providing a bus from the church to the hall, which will leave immediately after the ceremony.
Again, the hall also has plenty of parking.

If you're coming for the evening buffet, we're going to have a minibus from the city centre to Killearn.
It's going to leave at 7pm from outside Glasgow City Chambers, and it should be marked Whitestar.
Since the driver won't know exactly how many people will be getting on it, the minibus will be leaving promptly at seven, so make sure you're not late!

At the end of the night, the coaches will be returning to Glasgow City Centre, and there should be enough space for everyone who indicated they were interested.
