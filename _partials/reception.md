## Reception

After the ceremony, we're going to be moving on to the reception at the lovely Killearn Village Hall, with picturesque views of the surrounding Campsies.

The timetable's very provisional at the moment, but we're expecting it to be something like:

* 4pm: Drinks and photos
* 6pm: Dinner
* 8pm: Ceilidh
* 12pm: Finish

Again, the hall has parking, but we'll also probably provide a bus from the church to the hall, and back into Glasgow city centre at night (so let us know if provisionally you want to bag yourself a spot).
