  <p>We’re getting married – come join us!</p>

  <p>Oh, right, you probably need a bit more information than that. Luckily, we’re here to help. Read on …</p>

  <h2 id="ceremony">Ceremony</h2>
  <p><a name="ceremony"></a></p>

  <p>For our ceremony, we wanted something that meant something to both of us.
Since Steven’s parents are from Maryhill, we’re going to hold our ceremony there, at the church of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception, and the ceremony will (hopefully) be carried out by Felicity’s childhood priest, Fr. Kieron (possibly with the assistance of Fr. Jim) , who’ll be flying up for the occasion. Don’t worry we will be providing orders of service and it won’t be a full nuptial mass.</p>

  <p><img src="/images/church.jpg" alt="" /></p>

  <p>The ceremony will start at 2pm.
The church is on Maryhill Road, a couple of minutes walk from Maryhill train station, and it also has plenty of parking.
We’re also considering the possibility of putting on a bus from Glasgow city centre, so do let us know if you think you’d want to take advantage of that.</p>

  <p>Anybody who’s planning on arriving early (hint: all of you!) might want to know there might be another wedding on before ours, but they should be out the way in plenty of time.</p>

  <h2 id="reception">Reception</h2>

  <p>After the ceremony, we’re going to be moving on to the reception at the lovely Killearn Village Hall, with picturesque views of the surrounding Campsies.</p>

  <p><img src="/images/hall.jpg" alt="" /></p>

  <p>The timetable is still provisional at the moment, but we’re expecting it to be something like:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>15:30 – Drinks and photos</li>
    <li>17:00 – Dinner</li>
    <li>20:00 – Ceilidh</li>
    <li>00:00 – Finish</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Again, the hall has parking, but we’ll also probably provide a bus from the church to the hall, and back into Glasgow city centre at night (so let us know if provisionally you want to bag yourself a spot).</p>

  <h2 id="wedding-party">Wedding Party</h2>
  <p><a name="party"></a></p>

  <p>Since many of you won’t know everyone involved in the wedding, we thought we’d tell you a little bit about everyone.
Don’t worry about remembering it all, Steven will probably recycle most of it in his speech.</p>

  <h3 id="the-bride-felicity">The Bride: Felicity</h3>

  <p>Felicity is smart, sweet, caring and dedicated to the things she believes in.
Steven first met Felicity when they were both doing their PhDs and involved in the GIST, a science magazine.
Obviously, this shared interest should have led to love at first sight, but instead Steven decided Felicity was “a bit posh”, and promptly made no effot to get to know her for several months.
Fate wouldn’t keep them apart however, and when Steven started going along to the post-graduate society, which Felicity became President of, he started to realise quite how awesome she was.
What followed was a long period of Steven working a bit harder for the society than he would have otherwise, and trying to impress her with a variety of baked goods.
Amazingly, this strategy eventually paid off, and since they got together, they’ve seen each other through some hard times, and some amazing times, including Felicity proving just how much she loved him by proof-reading his thesis.
Felicity’s ability to make Steven happy just by being there, her sense of humour and loving nature have proved just how lucky he was, and will be for the rest of his life.</p>

  <p>Steven no longer works quite as hard to impress her, but she does still demand baked goods from time to time.</p>

  <h3 id="the-groom-steven">The Groom: Steven</h3>

  <p>Steven is a computer nerd, but luckily for him after getting to know him better, Felicity thinks that this is one of his most endearing features (and meant she had a really nicely formatted thesis).
Aside from his ability to photoshop the heads of animals onto the bodies of other animals (play ‘Galapa Go!’ if you struggle to see the appeal), Felicity also fell in love with his caring nature and ability to make her laugh.
She even managed to see past his like of bands she had never heard of and love of maths puns.
He is a great cook with his Burn’s night supper being the unmissable event of the year, and any post wedding weight gain will be due to him being forced to make his delicious (but highly calorific) white chocolate and raspberry cheesecake on a weekly basis.</p>

  <p>In short Steven is one of a kind and sorry ladies, he is off the market.</p>

  <h3 id="brides-parents-bob--terry">Bride’s Parents: Bob &amp; Terry</h3>

  <p>Worried about the prospect of meeting Felicity’s mum and dad, Steven tried to sweeten them up four months in advance by sending them down some home-made shortbread for Christmas.
He needn’t have worried however, as Bob &amp; Terry welcomed him into the family right from the start (either that or the shortbread worked).
Since then, Steven has seen just how much they care about Felicity, and what good parents they are.
He’s hoping that he can prove their trust in him is well-placed, and is looking forward to being part of their family for many years to come, despite the increase in the number of conversations about castles he has to take part in.</p>

  <h3 id="grooms-parents-michael--margaret">Groom’s Parents: Michael &amp; Margaret</h3>
  <p>Michael and Margaret have been very welcoming since they first met Felicity over a New Year’s Day pie.
There is always a can of full fat Coke or Irn-Bru waiting for her in their fridge and they very politely don’t mention when it is very obvious that she and Steven have come over to visit the puppy rather than them.
They are very generous and have made a real effort to make Felicity part of the family, although this may backfire if the house purchase falls through and she takes them up on the offer to move in.</p>

  <h3 id="best-man-gary">Best Man: Gary</h3>

  <p>Gary and Steven became friends over the course of second-year Latin class, where they shared an interest in playing table football and not paying much attention to Latin.
That friendship persisted all through school, university and beyond, despite living many miles from each other for several years.
Over time their shared interests grew to include wrestling, hill-walking, beer, boardgames, and an unhealthy interest in maths, mainly maths jokes.</p>

  <p>Neither of them remembers any Latin.</p>

  <h3 id="bridesmaids-nicola-tina--vicky">Bridesmaids: Nicola, Tina &amp; Vicky</h3>

  <p>Nicola and Felicity became friends when doing their PhDs at Strathclyde.
During this time they bonded over a love of Irn-Bru and Domino’s pizza and had several adventures including traveling across Lake Geneva on a paddle steamer (and somehow convincing the uni to pay for it).</p>

  <p>Tina had the misfortune to be stuck in the PhD office while on a year long placement.
Despite being a smelly undergrad she was welcomed into the fold and has become a source of great support and rude jokes.</p>

  <p>Vicky has known Felicity since school and despite this they are still friends.
Having started the friendship having long chats via MSN messenger, this switched to Facebook messenger and watching Downton Abbey with each other despite being at opposite ends of the country – technology at its finest.</p>

  <h3 id="ring-bearer-jamie">Ring-bearer: Jamie</h3>

  <p>Jamie is Felicity’s youngest cousin and is also her godson.
Felicity and Jamie spent one summer obsessively playing Lego Harry Potter on the Wii when Felicity was living nearby while on a 3 month placement at the Forensic Explosives Laboratory.
This also meant that Felicity got to be Jamie’s cool cousin who has a job blowing things up (not totally accurate, but she was happy to take the kudos).</p>

  <p><a name="food"></a></p>

  <p>Food will be provided by Three Sisters Bake.</p>

  <p>We want our wedding meal to be a relaxed affair so we will be serving food family style (in big bowls in the middle of the tables) with plenty of choice that you can mix and match. However, we know that some people will have specific dietary requirements and we will do our best to make sure everyone has something delicious that they can eat. Just remember to let us know your requirements when you RSVP.</p>

  <p>After the dinner, we’ll be rounding the celebration off in traditional style with a ceilidh.
This will be no surprise to many of you, but for those of you unfamiliar with what a ceilidh is we thought we’d provide you with some videos.</p>

  <p>First, to give you an idea, the highlight of any ceilidh, the Strip The Willow.</p>

  <iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gBCayM6aFJQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

  <p>Of course, we’ll probably ease you in a bit with something a bit simpler:</p>

  <iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4QyoSIQocKI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

  <p>But before long, we’re sure you’ll be ready for something a bit more challenging:</p>

  <h2 id="accommodation">Accommodation</h2>

  <p>Those of you travelling from outside Glasgow (or planning a very heavy night) will probably be looking for accommodation.
Glasgow has plenty of hotels available around the city centre, but we’ve found a couple to give you a head-start.

  <p>While we really don’t want anyone to feel that they must get us a gift, (seriously, we can’t stress that enough, your attendance and making it a special day to remember is what we want most of all) we keep getting asked about a gift list.</p>

  <p>We’ll be managing our gift list with <a href="https://www.prezola.com/wishlists/10156520">Prezola</a>, with a range of gifts including helping out with our honeymoon or a donation to charity.</p>
