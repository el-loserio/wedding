  <h2 id="welcome">Welcome</h2>

  <p>We’re getting married – come join us!</p>

  <p>Oh, right, you probably need a bit more information than that. Luckily, we’re here to help. Read on …</p>

  <h2 id="ceremony">Ceremony</h2>

  <p>For our ceremony, we wanted something that meant something to both of us.
Since Steven’s parents are from Maryhill, we’re going to hold our ceremony at the church of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception, and the ceremony will (hopefully) be carried out by Felicity’s childhood priest, Fr. Kieron (possibly with the assistance of Fr. Jim) , who’ll be flying up for the occasion. Don’t worry we will be providing orders of service and it won’t be a full nuptial mass.</p>

  <p><img src="/images/church.jpg" alt="" /></p>

  <p>The ceremony will (probably) start at 2pm.
The church is on Maryhill Road, a couple of minutes walk from Maryhill train station, and it also has plenty of parking.
We’re also considering the possibility of putting on a bus from Glasgow city centre, so do let us know if you think you’d want to take advantage of that.</p>

  <h2 id="reception">Reception</h2>

  <p>After the ceremony, we’re going to be moving on to the reception at the lovely Killearn Village Hall, with picturesque views of the surrounding Campsies.</p>

  <p><img src="/images/hall.jpg" alt="" /></p>

  <p>The timetable’s very provisional at the moment, but we’re expecting it to be something like:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>4pm: Drinks and photos</li>
    <li>6pm: Dinner</li>
    <li>8pm: Ceilidh</li>
    <li>12pm: Finish</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Again, the hall has parking, but we’ll also probably provide a bus from the church to the hall, and back into Glasgow city centre at night (so let us know if provisionally you want to bag yourself a spot).</p>

  <h2 id="food">Food</h2>

  <p>Food will be provided by Three Sisters Bake.</p>

  <p>We want our wedding meal to be a relaxed affair so we will be serving food family style (in big bowls in the middle of the tables) with plenty of choice that you can mix and match. However, we know that some people will have specific dietary requirements and we will do our best to make sure everyone has something delicious that they can eat. Just remember to let us know your requirements when you RSVP.</p>

</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="music">Music</h2>

  <p>There’ll be a ceilidh.</p>

  <p>For those of you not familiar with what a ceilidh is we have provided a few videos to give you an idea.</p>
